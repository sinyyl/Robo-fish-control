# Robo-fish-control
This is an controlling program for our robotic fish, which includes read of RC signals and control of servos using Raspberry Pi.

The whole project is aimed at designing, manufracturing and testing a robotic fish used for underwater exploration with concealment. So 
that observation of marine creatures can be conducted without disturbance.

This github repository contains the controlling code for the controller of the robotic fish. One version is for the Arduino which uses C++.
The other version for Raspberry Pi uses Python.
